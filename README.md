Database:
1. Connect to database using any client application. 
2. Create a Database

Code: 
1. The .env is already included, change the database name as per your db. 
2. For uploading the pictures to the Azure blob storage I have already attached my connection string and container name.
3. Install the dependencies using "npm intall".
4. Start the application using "npm run start".
5. Try the api in postman, endpoint for upload POST API "http://localhost:3000/api/cat-snap"


Aplogies:

I have started the project using a blank folder and haven't use any boiler plate project for the typescript project setup as I wanted to put my best forward. I have setup everything on my own using tsc, ts config, db connection, swagger, azure blob storage setup and connection. 
I haven't been able to complete the project but have done whatever I could have done in a span of 3 days.
Multiple lines of code had been commented in the snaps.ts controller and swagger.yaml. I would request you to go through the standards that I have followed in the project.
If given more time I would try to complete the project in the best way possible.
